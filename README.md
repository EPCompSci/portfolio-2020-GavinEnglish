#Zucc Succ App: 
https://github.com/GavinEnglish/Zucc-Succ

This was my first ever project on MIT app inventor. This games objective was for the user to eat as 15 flies without eating an onion. As levels progress there are more onions and it becomes harder to eat the flies. On any level the user can decide to continue past 15 flies and go for a new personal record.
