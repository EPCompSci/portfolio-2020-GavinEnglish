# 2020-2021 Portfolio (More info on my projects and screenshots of how the apps look are in their individual Github links)

Hi, my name is Gavin Engilsh, I am currently a senior at Eden Prairie High School. Most my computer science knowledge comes from AP Computer Science Principles, IOS App Development, Computer Science Honors Society, and self reasearch. I really enjoy the different aspects of developing an app (Coding, Art / Animations, Team Collaboration, etc.) and hope to further my knowledge of computer science in the years to come.

# Calculator App: 
https://github.com/GavinEnglish/Calculator 

This was the first app I started working on in IOS App Development. I followed youtube videos to learn the basics of V-Stacks, H-Stacks, and Z-stacks. Then I made my app icon with green and blue colors, which were the colors of the calculators buttons. Currently, the calculator only functions in a way that when you click the buttons it inputs what the button says onto the calculator. The reason I decided to not figure out math and functions is because I wanted to start working on a new project, rather than figuring out how to implement math on xcode.

# Nintendo Radio App: 
https://github.com/GavinEnglish/Nintendo-Radio

This was the second app I created in IOS App Development. The main things I learned were first developing my knowledge of the different stacks, how to play / pause / skip songs, and how to import songs into xcode and what format the audio had to be in in order to do so. What this app did was when you hit play it played a song from a Nintendo game, and then allow you to skip songs or to pause them.

# Flappy Turtle App: 
https://github.com/GavinEnglish/FlappyTurtle

This was my final AP Computer Science Principles project. The object of this game was for the user to get the highest score possible by making the turtle go between the two straws without touching either of the straws. 

# Zucc Succ App: 
https://github.com/GavinEnglish/Zucc-Succ

This was my first ever project on MIT app inventor. This games objective was for the user to eat as 15 flies without eating an onion. As levels progress there are more onions and it becomes harder to eat the flies. On any level the user can decide to continue past 15 flies and go for a new personal record. 

# Super Bird Fighter Ultra App: 
https://github.com/AnthonyKuismi/Super-Bird-Fighter-Ultra

This was my first group project in IOS App Development. Super Bird Fighter Ultra is a game with the main objective of the user being a character that punches the boss chicken to earn points, but if hit by the boss chickens eggs 5 times, then they lose and can start over. I learned a lot through my team and I creating this app. The main things I learned include: How to use app store connect, Various different aspects of finding music / sfx, How to use art in an app, and how to code different parts of a game.

# Pong App

This was the final app that me and a group worked on in IOS App Development. We mainly learned how to make this app to expand our knowledge of coing using SwiftUI.
