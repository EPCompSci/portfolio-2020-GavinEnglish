# 2020-2021 Portfolio (More info on my projects and screenshots of how the apps look are in their individual Github links)

Hi, my name is Gavin Engilsh .........

# Calculator App: 
https://github.com/GavinEnglish/Calculator 

This was the first app I started working on in IOS app development. I followed youtube videos to learn the basics of V-Stacks, H-Stacks, and Z-stacks. Then I made my app icon with green and blue colors, which were the colors of the calculators buttons. Currently, the calculator only functions in a way that when you click the buttons it inputs what the button says onto the calculator. The reason I decided to not figure out math and functions is because I wanted to start working on a new project, rather than figuring out how to implement math on xcode.

# Nintendo Radio App:

# Flappy Turtle App: 
https://github.com/GavinEnglish/FlappyTurtle

This was my final AP Computer Science Principles project. The object of this game was for the user to get the highest score possible by making the turtle go between the two straws without touching either of the straws. 

# Zucc Succ App: 
https://github.com/GavinEnglish/Zucc-Succ

This was my first ever project on MIT app inventor. This games objective was for the user to eat as 15 flies without eating an onion. As levels progress there are more onions and it becomes harder to eat the flies. On any level the user can decide to continue past 15 flies and go for a new personal record.
